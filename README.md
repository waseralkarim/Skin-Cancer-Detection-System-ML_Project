# Skin Cancer Detection System - ML Project

This project focuses on building a **Skin Cancer Detection System** using machine learning techniques. The aim is to accurately classify skin lesions as benign or malignant using image-based data. This can assist in early diagnosis and support medical professionals in detecting skin cancer efficiently.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide. Early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. This project utilizes image classification models to automate the diagnosis of skin lesions, providing a low-cost, scalable solution.
